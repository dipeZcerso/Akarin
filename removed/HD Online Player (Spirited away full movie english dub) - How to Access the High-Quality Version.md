1. **Spirited Away was created without a script**. Despite having a rich plot with developed characters, Spirited Away was not made with a script. In fact, Miyazaki's films never had scripts. \"I don't have the story finished and ready when we start work on a film,\" the filmmaker told Midnight Eye. \"I usually don't have the time. So the story develops when I start drawing storyboards. The production starts very soon thereafter, while the storyboards are still developing.\" Miyazaki does not know where the plot is going, and he lets it happen organically. \"It's not me who makes the film. The film makes itself and I have no choice but to follow\"[^1^].
2. **The cleansing of the river spirit is based on a real-life incident**. The scene where Chihiro helps clean the river spirit that is covered in garbage and sludge is based on a real-life incident in Hayao Miyazaki's life. He participated in the cleaning of a river, removing, among other things, a bicycle[^1^]. He wanted to show the environmental message of how humans pollute nature and how nature can heal itself with care and respect.
3. **The film was inspired by a 10-year-old girl**. Although Hayao Miyazaki had considered retiring after completing Princess Mononoke (1997), he was inspired to make this film after seeing a friend's sullen 10-year-old daughter. He wanted to make a film that would appeal to her and other young girls who were about to enter adulthood. He also wanted to create a heroine who was not a princess or a warrior, but an ordinary girl who finds her inner strength and courage[^1^].
4. **The jumping lamp is a nod to Pixar**. When Chihiro arrives at Zeniba's house, the jumping lamp with sound effect is a nod to the Pixar logo. Miyazaki is a fan of Pixar's films and has a friendship with John Lasseter, who helped produce the English dub of Spirited Away. Lasseter also visited Miyazaki's studio and gave him a Luxo Jr. lamp as a gift[^1^] [^2^].
5. **The film broke box office records in Japan**. Spirited Away is not only critically acclaimed, but also commercially successful. It is the first film to earn US$200 million in grosses before opening in the U.S[^1^]. It also became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, surpassing Titanic (1997). It held that record until 2020, when it was surpassed by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mugen Train (2020)[^3^].

These are some of the trivia facts about Spirited Away that you might find fascinating. This film is truly a masterpiece that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received.
