## DBZ - All Sagas Final
 
This map is based on the original DBZ - All Sagas map by GoonRacer, but it has been improved and updated by other map makers. It covers all the major sagas from the DBZ anime, from the Saiyan Saga to the Buu Saga. You can choose from five playable characters: Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Goten + Trunks, and Gohan. Each character has different abilities, transformations, and storylines. You can train your character by fighting enemies, completing quests, or using special items. You can also team up with other players or fight against them in multiplayer mode. This map is one of the most complete and faithful adaptations of the DBZ story in StarCraft.[^1^]
 
## DBZ - All Sagas Godly
 
This map is a spin-off of the DBZ - All Sagas Final map, but it adds some new features and challenges. It has more characters to choose from, such as Broly, Cell, Frieza, and Majin Buu. It also has more transformations, such as Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue. The enemies are stronger and more diverse, and the map is larger and more detailed.

## DBZ Sagas

You can explore the world of DBZ, interact with other characters, join factions, make choices, and influence the outcome of the story. You can also learn new skills and techniques by training with masters or finding scrolls. This map is more suitable for players who want a more immersive and creative experience.[^3^] [^4^]
